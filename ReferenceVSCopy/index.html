        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in

        // or use the new ES6 Spread

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects

        console.log(person)

        //create a copy with ES6
        const cap3 = {
            ...person //if there will be another nested object it won't be spread, spread goes one level deep
        }

            name: 'Al',

                fb: 'al.fb'
            }
        }

        const spreadAl = {
            ...al //inner object is still a reference
        }

        spreadAl.social.tweeter = '@OMG'

        console.log(spreadAl)
        console.log(al) //if you need a deep copy use a function

        //another way to make a deep copy is using JSON parse and stringify methods
        const al2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(al))
        al2.social.fb = 'no reference in here'
        console.table(al)
        console.table(al2)

        // and think we make a copy:

        // how do we take a copy instead?

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
